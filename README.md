## Problem Statement:
Infrastructure is getting “smart”, with sensors and Internet of things (IoT) increasingly embedded in the built environment (e.g. Punggol Digital District). How might we leverage a network of smart infrastructure in the built environment to make better and more timely sense of emergency incidents (e.g. detection of fires developing, building collapses, falls, road traffic accidents etc.) and to trigger early intervention measures, without the need to activate precious emergency resources?

### Description of the problem and how technology can help
Tackling the issue of reducing the need to activate precious emergency resources, we need an efficient platform that can activate the corresponding protocol in events of emergency and verify the validity of the incident so as to effectively address the situation without incurring excessive resources, especially in cases of false events. In this case, we will be focusing on the issues of fire outbreak. There is a bigger space for improvement which can even include accidents such as vehicle collision and building collapse events.

### Getting Started
We do not have the software available as our team do not possess the expertise. We however do have the idea and skeletal code for the implementation.

### What my team used to build the solution
- IBM Watson Studio
- Machine Learning
- AutoAI
- Jupyter
