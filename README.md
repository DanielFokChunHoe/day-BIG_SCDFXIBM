Problem Statement:
Infrastructure is getting “smart”, with sensors and Internet of things (IoT) increasingly embedded in the built environment (e.g. Punggol Digital District). How might we leverage a network of smart infrastructure in the built environment to make better and more timely sense of emergency incidents (e.g. detection of fires developing, building collapses, falls, road traffic accidents etc.) and to trigger early intervention measures, without the need to activate precious emergency resources?

Tackling the issue of reducing the need to activate precious emergency resources, we need an efficient platform that can activate the corresponding protocol in events of emergency and verify the validity of the incident so as to effectively address the situation without incurring excessive resources
